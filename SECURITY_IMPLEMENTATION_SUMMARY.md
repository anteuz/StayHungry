## Security Rules Deployed

The security rules have been successfully deployed to Firebase and are now active. Users can only access their own data, and all database operations require authentication.

## Next Steps

1. **Test the implementation** with multiple user accounts
2. **Monitor Firebase Console** for any security rule violations
3. **Consider additional features** like admin roles if needed
4. **Implement automated testing** for security measures

## Verification

To verify the security implementation:

1. **Test with authenticated user**: Should be able to access their own data
2. **Test with unauthenticated user**: Should be redirected to sign-in
3. **Test cross-user access**: Should be denied by security rules
4. **Check Firebase Console**: Monitor for any security violations

The implementation is now complete and ready for production use.
