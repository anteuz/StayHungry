# Ionic Icons Missing Issue - RESOLVED ✅

## Summary
Fixed the missing Ionic icons issue in the StayHungry application by correcting the Angular configuration path for SVG icon assets.

## Root Cause
The Ionic icons were missing because the Angular configuration in `angular.json` had an incorrect path for copying the SVG icon files. The configuration was looking for icons in:
```
node_modules/ionicons/dist/ionicons/svg
```

But the actual path was:
```
node_modules/@ionic/angular/node_modules/ionicons/dist/ionicons/svg
```

## Changes Made

### 1. Fixed Angular Configuration Path ✅
**File:** `angular.json`
- Updated the SVG assets path from `node_modules/ionicons/dist/ionicons/svg` to `node_modules/@ionic/angular/node_modules/ionicons/dist/ionicons/svg`
- This ensures all Ionic icons are properly copied to the build output

### 2. Updated CSS Import Syntax ✅
**File:** `src/global.scss`
- Fixed the deprecated `~@ionic/angular/css/` import syntax
- Changed to modern `@ionic/angular/css/` syntax for Angular 20 compatibility

### 3. Verified Icon Availability ✅
- Confirmed all required icons are present in the SVG directory
- Tested that SVG files are accessible from the built application
- Verified that the build process correctly copies all icon files

## Verification Results
- ✅ Build completes successfully
- ✅ SVG icons are copied to `www/svg/` directory
- ✅ All required icons (basket, menu, settings, etc.) are available
- ✅ SVG files are accessible via HTTP server
- ✅ No console errors related to missing icons

## Files Modified
1. `angular.json` - Fixed SVG assets path
2. `src/global.scss` - Updated CSS import syntax
3. `src/tsconfig.app.json` - Minor configuration updates

## Testing
- Built the application successfully with `npm run build`
- Verified SVG icons are accessible at `http://localhost:8080/svg/basket.svg`
- Confirmed all icon names used in templates are available in the SVG directory

## Current Status
The Ionic icons should now be displaying correctly throughout the application. The issue was purely a configuration problem with the asset copying path, not a missing dependency or component registration issue.

## Branch Information
- **Branch:** `fix/ionic-icons-missing`
