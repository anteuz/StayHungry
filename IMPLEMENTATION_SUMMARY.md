## üõ°Ô∏è Security Vulnerabilities Addressed

### Critical Issues Fixed
- **Authentication Bypass**: AuthGuard was completely broken
- **Input Validation**: No validation on user inputs
- **Information Disclosure**: Excessive console logging
- **Access Control**: Missing Firebase security rules
- **File Upload**: No restrictions on file uploads

### Security Measures Implemented
- **Authentication**: Proper user authentication and session management
- **Authorization**: User-specific data access controls
- **Input Validation**: Comprehensive validation with security requirements
- **File Security**: Upload restrictions and validation
- **Error Handling**: Sanitized error messages
- **Database Security**: Firebase rules preventing unauthorized access

## üìä Test Coverage Strategy

### Integration Test Focus
1. **Authentication Workflows** - Complete sign-in/sign-up flows
2. **Data Management** - Shopping list CRUD operations with security
3. **File Operations** - Upload/download with security validation
4. **Cross-Service Integration** - Service interaction validation
5. **Security Boundaries** - Authentication and authorization enforcement

### Test Types Implemented
